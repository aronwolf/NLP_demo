# NLP_demo
This repository is a sample of the work that I have done in natural language processing for automated keywording and subject extraction and summarization. I have (unfortunately) never had anyone else to collaborate with, so this code is largely unreviewed, but I hope it shows the directions in which my brain has gone when left to my own development devices.

The sample data is significantly reduced so as to not put too much project specific content available on the open web, but this codebase is designed to function optimally with vocabularies of several tens of thousands of normalized keywords, and roughly as many semantically significant concept statements. Neo4j was chosen for the graph database underpinnings because it is an open source project, and very powerful in modeling the multiple potential data relationships, as well as its scalability.
